coffee app

Goal - the app is meant to connect coffee enthusiasts on a social media-like platform 



- the account is created with an email, then the user will be able to make a username and password
- the app will be smooth and user-friendly
- something like instagram with the option of shopping, but it isn't advertised and shoved down your throat
- will be built for iOS, Andriod
- just need birthday, name, email and username/password once the account has been created
- a mobile app and will be available on website
